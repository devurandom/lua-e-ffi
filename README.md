Lua FFI bindings for the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries

# EFL LuaJIT bindings: ELua and Lualian

Please note that EFL comes with [LuaJIT bindings](https://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git/tree/src/bindings/luajit) these days. An entrypoint might be the [Elua](https://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git/tree/src/lib/elua) library â€” it "was created to ease integration of EFL Lua into other EFL libraries or applications. Using the Elua library you can easily create a Lua state that is fully set up for running EFL Lua bindings."
